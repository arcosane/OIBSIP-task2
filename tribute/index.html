                <p>Lionel Andrés Mess (born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team.
                    Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.
                    [note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. <br><br>
                    
                    <strong><u>Early Life</u></strong><br>
                    Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe,[10] the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. 
                    On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the north-central Adriatic Marche region of Italy, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.
                    [3] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.
                    [11] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.
                    [12] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Roman Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother. <br><br>

                    <strong><u>Career</u></strong><br>
                    2003-05: Rise to the first team <BR>    
                    During the 2003-04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, 
                    Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign. <br><br>
                    2005-08: Making the starting eleven <br>
                    On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. <br><br>
                    2008-09: Winning the sextuple <br>
                    Barça's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as they became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year. <br><br>
                    2010-11: Continued success <br>
                    At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy's history. <br><br>
                    2012: A record-breaking year <br>
                    20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada. <br><br>

                    Barcelona lost 7-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munchen. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player. <br><br>

                    Messi capped off the year by opening the scoring in the 36th minute of the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona went on to defeat River Plate 3-0 in Yokohama, and winning the tournament's Silver Ball, despite missing the semi-final. <br><br>

                    Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3-1 home victory over Olympiacos.
                    Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart. <br><br>
                    2018-19: Captaincy, 10th La Liga title, and a record sixth Golden Boot <br>
                    With the departure of former captain Andrés Iniesta in May 2018, Messi was named the team's new captain for the following season.[243] On 12 August, he lifted his first title as Barcelona's captain, the Supercopa de España, following a 2-1 victory over Sevilla. On 19 August, Messi scored twice in helping Barcelona defeat Alavés 3-0 in their first La Liga match of the season, with his first goal, a free kick that he rolled under the jumping Alavés wall, making history in being Barcelona's 6000th goal in La Liga. <br><br>
                    2019-20: Record sixth Ballon d'Or <br>
                    On 5 August 2019, it was announced that Messi would miss Barcelona's US tour after sustaining a right calf injury.[263] On 19 August, Messi's chipped goal from the edge of the box against Real Betis was nominated for the 2019 FIFA Puskás Award. <br><br>
                    2020: Desire to leave Barcelona <br>
                    Following growing dissatisfaction with the direction of Barcelona on and off the field,[288] Barcelona announced that Messi sent the club "a document expressing his desire to leave" on 25 August 2020 <br><br>
                    2020-21: Final season at Barcelona <br>
                    At the end of this season, in a tearful press conference held at the Camp Nou, Messi confirmed that he would be leaving Barcelona. <br><br>
                    2021-22: First season adjustments <br>
                    On 10 August, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain.[323] He signed a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[324] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona. <br><br>
                    2022-23: Regaining form and World Champions
                    Tied 3-3 after extra-time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Messi scored Argentina's first goal in the shoot-out, with Argentina eventually winning 4-2, ending the nation's 36-year wait for the trophy.[497] Messi received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament, becoming the first player to win it twice. He finished second in the Golden Boot race with seven goals in seven games, one behind Mbappé. <br><br></p>
